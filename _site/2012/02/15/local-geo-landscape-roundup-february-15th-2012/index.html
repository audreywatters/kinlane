A few weeks ago, more than 60 new timeline apps went live. These apps - many in the lifestyle category - broadened what was available to people on Facebook beyond the music, news and video apps that were introduced at f8 in September. Music apps like Spotify, Songza and Deezer are seeing dramatic increases in sharing and music discovery.</li>
<li><a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">Announcing The Facebook Mobile Platform Global Hacks Roadshow- Europe</a>&nbsp;- (02/13/2012) - In October, we announced the Facebook Mobile Platform, bringing social channels and distribution to mobile apps. Since then, momentum has been building, and today, more than 60 million visitors interact with apps and games on the platform every month. In October we also invited mobile developers to join us for a Mobile Hack in Palo Alto. We later visited mobile developers in New York and Boston to hold similar events. Hundreds joined us at each event, learned about the Facebook Mobile Platform, worked on mobile hack projects, and presented them to panels of VCs and tech executives. We were thrilled that these mobile hack events attracted developers from around the world, from as far afield as London, Israel and Brazil.</li>
<li><a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">Platform Updates: Operation Developer Love</a>&nbsp;- (02/10/2012) - This week, we posted blogs on Creating Featured Stories with Action Specs and Developer Blog Subscriptions.

Like the Watch action or any custom action, you will still have to submit this action for review before you can go live. Please check out the documentation and requirements for Built-in Action Types.

New Payer Promotions Facebook has begun sponsoring promotions to help developers convert game players into paying users. We are currently running an offer to encourage game players to make a first-time purchase using their credit card or PayPal account. This offers allows the user to earn $4 of value for free by purchasing 10 Facebook Credits at the regular price of $1. Users outside the US will see the same offer expressed in their local currency. There are two versions of this offer currently running on the platform.</li>

We fixed this bug today and sent out all posts that were never delivered. This ensured that you didn't miss any important announcements (some posts dated back to mid-January).

We&rsquo;ve discussed this topic a number of times in this blog and Flip will be presenting on how this concept affects the way we ask questions and find answers about Big Data.
