I need to know if an API will work for me, and getting started immediately will make the difference between using and walking away Reliability - I&rsquo;m depending on an API, if its not reliable, I can&rsquo;t depend on for my application. There are many aspects of API management that goes into reliability--spend the time to understand what it takes Terms of Use - Nothing stops a great application idea more than restrict terms of use. Make the legaleze as developer friendly as you can Communication - Regular communication with developers goes a long ways. Whether blog posts, tweets or working with developers in person at hackathons, communication is an essential for me to adopt an API Usage Analytics - As a developer I need to understand how I&rsquo;m using an API.

                <p>I was directed to an API question today, that needs to be asked constantly in the space:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>What&rsquo;s your biggest web API pet peeve? What drives you crazy when integrating with a new API?</p>

<p>My response was:</p>

<p>This is such a relevant topic I wanted to continue the conversation by listing the top 10 things that drive me crazy when integrating with a new API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Incomplete or Cumbersome Documentation</strong> - Definitely something that will keep you from a achieving a successful integration and make you walk away from an API</li>
<li><strong>Lacking Code Samples &amp; Libraries</strong> - The programming language i&rsquo;m using could vary from project to project, and the code samples and libraries can make or break my successful integration</li>
<li><strong>Senseless Rate Limiting</strong> - Rate limits are an essential part of API management, but placing of rate limits unecessarily and without pressure release options, doesn&rsquo;t make sense</li>
<li><strong>No Self-Service Registration</strong> - As a developer, I need instant gratification.  I need to know if an API will work for me, and getting started immediately will make the difference between using and walking away</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - I&rsquo;m depending on an API, if its not reliable, I can&rsquo;t depend on for my application.  There are many aspects of API management that goes into reliability--spend the time to understand what it takes</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Nothing stops a great application idea more than restrict terms of use.  Make the legaleze as developer friendly as you can</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Regular communication with developers goes a long ways.  Whether blog posts, tweets or working with developers in person at hackathons, communication is an essential for me to adopt an API</li>
<li><strong>Usage Analytics </strong>- As a developer I need to understand how I&rsquo;m using an API.  As an API owner, you should be tracking every aspect of API operations, make sure and share some of this insight with developers</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- A business model for both API provider and consumer is essential for a healthy API experience.  If the API provider isn&rsquo;t making money or delivering value, it&rsquo;s not sustainable--if the developer can&rsquo;t pay the bills, their integrations will not survive</li>
<li><strong>Clear Pricing</strong> - If I don't know what it will cost for me to accomplish what I need with an API, there is very little chance I will integrate it into my application. I've become very accustomed to knowing my AWS bill, with the clear pricing they provide</li>
</ul>
<p>All nine of these items go into establishing trust between API provider and consumer.  There are some APIs I just trust and others I don&rsquo;t.  Delivery in these nine areas, all feed into whether I trust an API for my business or not</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p><a title="I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business</a>.  I&rsquo;m working to add more to this stack, and as a developer I can identify if an API has value within seconds, and hopefully have it integrated with in minutes or at the most a couple of hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API provider, make sure and find out what drives your developers crazy while integrating, and see what you can do to reduce friction in these nine areas. &nbsp;</p>
