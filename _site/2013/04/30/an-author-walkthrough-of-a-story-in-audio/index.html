<p>I was finally catching up on all my podcasts this week, which includes <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, which is an always informative source of n<span>ews and commentary podcast about APIs and the cloud hosted by&nbsp;</span><a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While listening to&nbsp;<a href="http://trafficandweather.io/post/46485798823/episode-8-im-going-to-withdraw-my-objection">Episode 8: I&rsquo;m going to withdraw my objection</a>, John Sheehan discusses his March story in NextWeb called&nbsp;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/03/12/apis-are-dead-long-live-apis/?fromcat=all">APIs are Dead, Long Live APIs</a>. &nbsp;It was very interesting to hear him describe his intent behind the post and walk us through his points. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the original article back in March, jotted down some notes, but really didn't trigger much beyond that. &nbsp;After listening to him talk about the post, it renewed some very interesting points for me--which I'm working through an dyou will see in future blog posts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is a lot of work</span> to craft a good quality blog posts that conveys difficult and often abstract API concepts to a wide audience. &nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather-virtualized-api-stacks/">I struggle with getting my ideas across, as well as coherency in much of my writing</a>. This got me thinking, maybe as part of my storytelling process I can try to work in an audio version, of me walking my readers (listeners) through it.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about something that reads the post to you. I'm talking about, me, actually walking you through the subject matter and post. &nbsp;We'll see. &nbsp;It is something I likely won't have time for with each post, but it would fun to try. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I really have been trying to incorporate more audio and video into more of my content creation, but seem to be falling short. &nbsp;I will keep trying until something sticks!</p>
