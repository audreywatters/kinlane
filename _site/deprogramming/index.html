                <p>I have done a good job over the last decade at deprogramming from the previous four decades, with the essential ingredient being the injection of more diverse voices into my head, reading the stories of all of these amazing authors. I am very thankful for being able to decouple myself from the television and the Internet to make my way through these nourishing stories. </p>

            <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/bunk">Bunk</a> by Kevin Young - This one laid an important foundation for me, demonstrating how so much of my reality is fabricated and a spectacle. It began my journey into questioning the stories I have been told, dismantling P.T. Barnum, but more importantly, The Education of Little Tree which was given to be as a child, and became such an important narrative in the back of my mind. Bunk cracked open for me just how everything we believe is well, Bunk.

I grew up poor so the phrase "White Trash" resonated with me and opened up some doors, helping me understanding how white supremacy perpetually divides and conquers, keeping us separated and at each others throats.

It helps you see that most of the rhetoric is born after WW II, and not a handed down tradition since the founding of this country. I mean the racism is, but the culture and consumer aspect is manufactured to just sell us a product that speaks to our identity. I spent summers doing 4H at the fairgrounds mentioned in the book. I can still count on all fingers family members I care deeply about who always have a gun on them, and who own 25 or 50+ guns and countless rounds of ammunition. I live in New York City as I read this book and I am extremely grateful for the careful research and storytelling in the book. It comes at a time when I needed this reinforcement. For me, there is a confidence in reading and having an understanding the root of this illness, in the same way I think that being ignorant and not understanding the world gave me a confidence that owning a gun was essential.

Everything has its roots in the opium trade. The industrial age all the way until today is built on top of the drug trade. It is all baked into everything. It isn't just some recent phenomenon, it has underpinned much of what we've been taught about history. Spreading opium and all of its derivatives around the globe was deliberate. It wasn't just shady criminals. It was the wealthy elite who run the world. This book hit on all the foundational illnesses with the world around us and shows me that it isn't me that is fucked up, it is capitalism. It is white supremacy. And opiates are in the cracks and shadows of almost every industry, and all western governments are complicit. There is no denying how we got here. It was a pretty damning look at how we got here, and made some realistic arguments about how we need to begin healing what keeps us so sick. Makes my stomach churn. Makes me want to drink some Pennyroyal tea.

            <a href="https://www.harvard.com/book/indigenous_continent/">Indigenous Continent, The Epic Contest for North America</a> by Pekka Hämäläinen - This is the indigenous history kids need to learn in school. This book reveals for me just how awful we are at history in the United States, which reaffirms to me why white dudes so venomously showcase and defend the shit simple history we get fed in schools and on television. We don't want to reveal the full story of just how incompetent, bumbling, and vicious the founding of this country was. This book gives indigenous a voice. It fills in the cracks for me what happened in between Columbus landing and moving indigenous onto reservations in the 19th century. It shows that it didn't take us 400 years to take over the US from coast to coast because it was so vast and empty, but because we were denied by powerful indigenous nations. This book paints an entirely different landscape of the founding of this country, and it's westward expansion than what you are spoon fed via mainstream channels in the United States. It is a must-read for anyone who pretends they care about this country, and want to understand what we need to do to begin healing--reparations for the indigenous people of this nation.

I knew that the way people tell the story of Luddites was misinformed, but this book revealed that the word was entirely appropriated by capitalists to degrade workers. This book helps shine a light on what was really going on in the moment, and elevates the term Luddite to an honorable thing, not what it has been reduced to in late stage capitalism. I would say I sheepishly recognized myself as a Luddite before reading this book, and afterwards I am proud to declare myself one, and refer to this book as the argument for my shift. I am not anti-technology, but I do care about the quality of my work, making a living wage, and having control over the technology that is used anywhere I work.

Defining and exploring the roots of my anxiety as I am experiencing it, further equipping me to pull back the curtain on our digital world and see the gears behind it. The book literally was describing what I was feeling as I struggled to read a paragraph and ignore the messages on my phone sitting next to me. A lot of this book was what I've already been immersed in, but it laid it on the table for me in some new ways that will help me deal with the path I am on right now, and how I struggle to put one foot in front of the other and keep marching through this very messy word I am thankful for living in.

<p>It takes work to de-program oneself. If you are serious about understanding how the United States works, and why we are in the state we are in, I highly recommend working your way through these titles. These stories have saved my soul, given me enough momentum to keep going in this messed up world, and begin to be more optimistic about how I can live my life in the most meaningful way possible.
