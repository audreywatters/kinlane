I went to bed pretty early last night. It was about 8:30 PM when I laid down, and about 10:00 PM before I fell asleep. As I was waking up at about 5:45 AM, I laid there thinking that going to bed was just preemptively sleeping in. I love to sleep in. I am not a morning person, although in the second half of my life I realized that I am a better person when I get up. So it makes sense for me to also begin to retire earlier in the evening.

I cherish being able to sleep in on the weekends and holidays. It is one of my favorite things to do. However I like the idea of going to bed earlier to achieve the same goal—-sleeping as much as I can. I love a good 8-9 hours of sleep in my old age. I am a better person when I get up early, so I might as well make the math work, any which way I can. If I get it on the front-end or tail-end, what does it matter? I know, I know. This is old person logic. That is OK, I am fine with that.

My 18 year old self would laugh at me. Hell, my 51 year old self is laughing at me. It is OK. Sleep is important. Getting enough sleep is probably one of the most important things I can be doing each day. Gone are the days where I stay up late coding. No more staying out partying. I’m officially old. It is OK. I had a good run. The balance is working for me, so I might as well go all in. I am getting better at planning, and I think my new preemptive sleeping in is just an example of planning for more comfort and stability in my life.
