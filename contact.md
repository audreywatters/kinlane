You can contact me with any questions or comments using the channels below, and I am happy to try and respond. I am bombarded with a lot of messages via different channels, so please be patient with me as I work my way through.

{% for info in site.data.contact %}
- [{{ info.name }}]({{ info.url }}) - {{ info.description }}
{% endfor %}

This site contains my personal stories, and my therapy. These blog posts aren't for you, they are for me. The storytelling here is letting me work through some of the dark things I have experienced in my past, as well as what I see today. You will find that things are getting increasingly bright as I work through things.

I am happy to entertain your thoughts and feedback.
